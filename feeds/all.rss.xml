If you wanted to do something new, you used to have to spend weeks getting the proper permissions / sign offs from the relevant leadership, ensure they were bought in to the vision of your project, talk to the resourcing team to make …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sanjay Saraf</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:svsaraf.github.io,2018-11-02:/minimize-the-distance-from-idea-to-execution.html</guid></item><item><title>Problems and solutions</title><link>https://svsaraf.github.io/problems-and-solutions.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Something I've noticed recently is that problems become a lot easier to solve if you describe them in detail. That is, attempting to solve a vague, multi-faceted issue is practically impossible, but cutting it down to a set of discrete problems seems to make it much more digestible.

Solid tumor patients can now expect to have their tumors sequenced and compared to normal cells in order to determine which targeted therapies are appropriate for their tumors. However, our ability to predict future behavior of an individual cancer is …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sanjay Saraf</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2018 06:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:svsaraf.github.io,2018-10-12:/pid-controllers-and-cancer-care.html</guid></item><item><title>Get bored.</title><link>https://svsaraf.github.io/get-bored.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking and talking about side projects for a long time. Now is the first time I've shipped something that 1) actually works and 2) has at least a snowball's chance of becoming something people use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that? I now get bored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't used to. It always …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sanjay Saraf</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:svsaraf.github.io,2018-10-10:/get-bored.html</guid></item><item><title>Side projects</title><link>https://svsaraf.github.io/side-projects.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple months I've been declaring all of my side projects to my current employer. It's been a very interesting experience, because, strictly speaking, I don't work for them as an engineer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Spolsky has written an interesting &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/developers-side-projects/"&gt;note about side projects&lt;/a&gt;.

Once they become aware, it becomes much easier to explain why they should pay off high interest loans as quickly as possible, and not keep too much cash lying around that isn't gathering interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people are always …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sanjay Saraf</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:svsaraf.github.io,2018-09-27:/momentum-equals-habit.html</guid></item><item><title>Holding it all in your head</title><link>https://svsaraf.github.io/holding-it-all-in-your-head.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Something I've noticed when working on larger programming projects is that my ability to add new code depends on what stage of the project I'm at. Early on, the code comes out fast.

For instance, if I asked you: "go out and get 10 more users", that's a tangible, easy to understand goal.

How are our conversations different from normal conversations, say with acquaintances? They appear to be oriented towards truth finding rather than opinion sermoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a degree of humility to say that you …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sanjay Saraf</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:svsaraf.github.io,2018-09-16:/a-modern-olympia-academy.html</guid></item><item><title>Human knowledge</title><link>https://svsaraf.github.io/human-knowledge.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It took Newton the better part of 3 years to 'invent' calculus.

This manifests in a few ways - the most painful one being that starting new projects &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; puts me through a maze of dependency management and reinstallations.
